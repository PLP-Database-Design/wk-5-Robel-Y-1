## Metrics

As **Test Manager**, I am responsible for tracking progress and quality metrics.  
The following metrics will be used to measure testing effectiveness:

| Metric | Formula | Target | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Test Case Pass Rate | (Passed / Total) √ó 100 | ‚â• 90% | Ensure sufficient coverage |
| Defect Density | Defects / Test Cases | ‚â§ 0.25 | Identify defect frequency |
| Risk Coverage | (Tested Risks / Total Risks) √ó 100 | ‚â• 80% | Confirm focus on high-risk areas |
| Regression Success Rate | (Re-tested Passed / Total Re-tested) √ó 100 | ‚â• 85% | Validate post-fix stability |

**Metric Tracking Approach:**  
Progress and results will be recorded in a shared Google Sheet linked to GitHub Issues, with daily updates from all members.

## Test Control & Project Management

### Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Actual Output | Variance | Owner |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Planning** | Test Plan + Schedule | Completed | 0% | **Robel** |
| **Coordination** | Task Distribution + GitHub Setup | Completed | 0% | **Robel** |
| **Progress Tracking** | Weekly Report + Metrics | In Progress | 10% | **Robel** |
| **Report Compilation** | Final Consolidated Report | Pending | - | **Robel** |

**Progress Tracking Method:**  
- GitHub Issues board for test execution and defect status.  
- Group check-ins every 2 days for task updates.  
- Status tracked using simple traffic lights (üü¢ On Track, üü° Delayed, üî¥ Risk).

**Change Control Notes:**  
Any schedule adjustments or test case updates must be approved by the Test Manager to maintain consistency.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Most Defect-Prone Area (Expected):** Leaderboard logic and localStorage data persistence.  
- **Risk Analysis Impact:** Helped narrow testing scope toward functional and logic-based risks first.  
- **Team Communication:** Coordination via GitHub Issues was efficient; fewer misunderstandings.  
- **Improvements for Next Cycle:** Use automated test tracking tools (like TestLink or Jira) for better traceability.
