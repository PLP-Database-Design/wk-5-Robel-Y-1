## Risk Analysis
##  Risk Analysis  

As **Risk Analyst**, my objective is to identify, assess, and prioritize risks that could affect the quality and success of the Word Puzzle Game Plus project. The analysis ensures that high-impact areas receive proper testing attention and that mitigation plans are in place.  

###  Objectives  
- Identify potential risks that could disrupt testing or gameplay.  
- Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.  
- Recommend mitigation strategies and link them to relevant test cases.  

---

###  Risk Identification and Assessment  

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **R1** | Game does not reset scores correctly after pressing ‚ÄúReset‚Äù | Medium | High | **High** | Conduct multiple reset tests and verify score persistence is cleared in localStorage |
| **R2** | Leaderboard fails to store top scores properly | High | High | **Critical** | Validate localStorage entries after each game and perform regression testing |
| **R3** | Bonus Round logic miscalculates double score | Medium | Medium | **Moderate** | Implement functional test cases for every third puzzle; verify calculation accuracy |
| **R4** | Game performance slows down during multiple puzzle rounds | Low | Medium | **Low** | Monitor browser console performance and memory usage |
| **R5** | Unclear UI feedback when resetting or starting new round | Medium | Low | **Moderate** | Conduct usability testing to ensure user messages and alerts are visible |

---

###  Risk Prioritization Summary  

| Risk Level | Count | Testing Focus |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Critical** | 1 | Must be tested first (Leaderboard logic) |
| **High** | 1 | Second priority ‚Äî affects score integrity |
| **Moderate** | 2 | Covered in functional and UI testing |
| **Low** | 1 | Optional if time allows |

---

###  Risk-Based Testing Approach  
Testing will follow a **risk-based prioritization** model:  
1. Begin with **Critical and High** risks (Leaderboard and Reset Game).  
2. Continue with **Moderate** UI and logic risks.  
3. Perform exploratory testing on Low-priority risks if time permits.  

Each identified risk is linked to corresponding test cases and defect reports to ensure traceability and control.  

---

###  Summary  
The risk analysis highlights that **data persistence and score accuracy** are the highest-impact areas for the Word Puzzle Game Plus. Focusing test efforts here will reduce the likelihood of major user experience issues and improve system reliability before release.
