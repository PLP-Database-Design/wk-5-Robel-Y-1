## Risk Analysis
##  Risk Analysis  

As **Risk Analyst**, my objective is to identify, assess, and prioritize risks that could affect the quality and success of the Word Puzzle Game Plus project. The analysis ensures that high-impact areas receive proper testing attention and that mitigation plans are in place.  

###  Objectives  
- Identify potential risks that could disrupt testing or gameplay.  
- Evaluate the likelihood and impact of each risk.  
- Recommend mitigation strategies and link them to relevant test cases.  

---

###  Risk Identification and Assessment  

| Risk ID | Description | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **R1** | Game does not reset scores correctly after pressing ‚ÄúReset‚Äù | Medium | High | **High** | Conduct multiple reset tests and verify score persistence is cleared in localStorage |
| **R2** | Leaderboard fails to store top scores properly | High | High | **Critical** | Validate localStorage entries after each game and perform regression testing |
| **R3** | Bonus Round logic miscalculates double score | Medium | Medium | **Moderate** | Implement functional test cases for every third puzzle; verify calculation accuracy |
| **R4** | Game performance slows down during multiple puzzle rounds | Low | Medium | **Low** | Monitor browser console performance and memory usage |
| **R5** | Unclear UI feedback when resetting or starting new round | Medium | Low | **Moderate** | Conduct usability testing to ensure user messages and alerts are visible |

---

###  Risk Prioritization Summary  

| Risk Level | Count | Testing Focus |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Critical** | 1 | Must be tested first (Leaderboard logic) |
| **High** | 1 | Second priority ‚Äî affects score integrity |
| **Moderate** | 2 | Covered in functional and UI testing |
| **Low** | 1 | Optional if time allows |

---

###  Risk-Based Testing Approach  
Testing will follow a **risk-based prioritization** model:  
1. Begin with **Critical and High** risks (Leaderboard and Reset Game).  
2. Continue with **Moderate** UI and logic risks.  
3. Perform exploratory testing on Low-priority risks if time permits.  

Each identified risk is linked to corresponding test cases and defect reports to ensure traceability and control.  

---

###  Summary  
The risk analysis highlights that **data persistence and score accuracy** are the highest-impact areas for the Word Puzzle Game Plus. Focusing test efforts here will reduce the likelihood of major user experience issues and improve system reliability before release.

## Metrics

As **Test Manager**, I am responsible for tracking progress and quality metrics.  
The following metrics will be used to measure testing effectiveness:

| Metric | Formula | Target | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| Test Case Pass Rate | (Passed / Total) √ó 100 | ‚â• 90% | Ensure sufficient coverage |
| Defect Density | Defects / Test Cases | ‚â§ 0.25 | Identify defect frequency |
| Risk Coverage | (Tested Risks / Total Risks) √ó 100 | ‚â• 80% | Confirm focus on high-risk areas |
| Regression Success Rate | (Re-tested Passed / Total Re-tested) √ó 100 | ‚â• 85% | Validate post-fix stability |

**Metric Tracking Approach:**  
Progress and results will be recorded in a shared Google Sheet linked to GitHub Issues, with daily updates from all members.

## Test Control & Project Management

### Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Actual Output | Variance | Owner |
|-------|--------------|----------------|-----------|--------|
| **Planning** | Test Plan + Schedule | Completed | 0% | **Robel** |
| **Coordination** | Task Distribution + GitHub Setup | Completed | 0% | **Robel** |
| **Progress Tracking** | Weekly Report + Metrics | In Progress | 10% | **Robel** |
| **Report Compilation** | Final Consolidated Report | Pending | - | **Robel** |

**Progress Tracking Method:**  
- GitHub Issues board for test execution and defect status.  
- Group check-ins every 2 days for task updates.  
- Status tracked using simple traffic lights (üü¢ On Track, üü° Delayed, üî¥ Risk).

**Change Control Notes:**  
Any schedule adjustments or test case updates must be approved by the Test Manager to maintain consistency.

---

## Lessons Learned

- **Most Defect-Prone Area (Expected):** Leaderboard logic and localStorage data persistence.  
- **Risk Analysis Impact:** Helped narrow testing scope toward functional and logic-based risks first.  
- **Team Communication:** Coordination via GitHub Issues was efficient; fewer misunderstandings.  
- **Improvements for Next Cycle:** Use automated test tracking tools (like TestLink or Jira) for better traceability.
